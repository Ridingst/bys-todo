# Welcome to our first ToDo app
This is a pretty simple todo app to get us used to using some dev tool.

1. First off we're going to get a static html material design page up
2. Next we add drag and drop cards and some structure to the page
3. Then we add the todo items as a data object
4. Then we add the ability to add a new todo item
5. Then we add the ability to change the status of todo items in the data
6. Then we add the ability to get all of the todos from the server on initialisation
7. Then we add a refresh of the todos on the server every 0.5s
