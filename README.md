# Welcome to our first ToDo app
This is a pretty simple todo app to get us used to using some dev tool.

## 1. First off we're going to get a static html material design page up

## 2. Next we add drag and drop cards and some structure to the page

## 3. Then we add the todo items as a data object

## 4. Then we add the ability to add a new todo item

## 5. Then we add the ability to change the status of todo items in the data

## 6. Then we add the ability to get all of the todos from the server on initialisation

## 7. Then we add a refresh of the todos on the server every 0.5s
